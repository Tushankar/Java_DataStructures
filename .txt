Array is linear data structure stored datas in contigous manner(first element of array will
have a adress such as base adresssuppose its 1000 is his adreess to find the next elemnt we
will add 4 to the adress as 4 is the size of the integer 4 bytes)

2 4 6 8 12 14 20 ->store always same type of data all integer
0 1 2 3 4  5  6  -> indexes so , if the size of array is n the last element will be at n-1

random accesss-> we can access any elements randomly directly just by passing the index number 
array.length always gives the size of the array

Size of array is fixed so static data type


Array implementation : 
int arr[];
int arr[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14};//Store elements in the array


1. Palindrome 

1 2 3 2 1  ->bt printing we get: 1,2,3,2,1
0 1 2 3 4 (index) ->if we print it reverse: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
